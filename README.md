# Query Insight Engine

🚀 **AI-Powered Media Planning Assistant**

The Query Insight Engine is a smart, AI-driven application designed to modernize media planning and marketing analytics workflows. It enables marketing teams to query complex datasets using natural language, replacing the need for manually operated spreadsheets and traditional reporting tools.

## ✨ Features

- **Conversational Intelligence**: Users can input queries in plain English, and the system decomposes them into sub-tasks using an agent-based architecture.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Supports sensitivity analysis, scenario comparisons, and goal-based configurations.
- **Modular Design**: Components are agent-based, allowing each part of the system to specialize in specific sub-tasks (e.g., classification, computation, reporting).
- **Scalability**: Built with automation and reuse in mind—suitable for handling large datasets and multiple scenario simulations.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **CrewAI** – for combine different agents
- **platform** – for rapid front-end deployment
- **OpenAI APIs** – for natural language understanding and query decomposition

## 📌 Use Case Example

> **Query**: “What is the impact of the media flight exceeding its budget by 20%?”

The system classifies the request as a sensitivity analysis, breaks down relevant variables, and returns a visual + narrative report with insights.

## ✅ What You Can Expect

- Faster, guided insights for media planners.
- Automation of repetitive analytics tasks.
- Unified interface for querying, analyzing, and visualizing media investment strategies.
